Undirected graphs of moderate to very large size can be drawn using `sfdp`, a scalable multilevel 
force directed algorithm. This graph, from the graphviz `tests/graphs` directory, has 1054 nodes,
and takes a few seconds using `sfdp`. Overlap of nodes are removed with `-Goverlap=prism` option.
More example of large graph layout can be found 
<a href="http://www.yifanhu.net/GALLERY/GRAPHS/"> here</a>.

Note that this requires Graphviz to have been built with the
[GNU Triangulated Surface Library](https://gts.sourceforge.net/). Graphviz on
Windows does not have this support. See
https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1269 for more details.
