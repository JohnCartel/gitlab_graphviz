description: How to initially layout nodes
---
Has the syntax `(style)?(seed)?`.

If `style` is present, it must be one of the strings:

- `"regular"`: place nodes regularly about a circle
- `"self"`: run an abbreviated version of neato  to obtain the initial layout
- `"random"`: place nodes randomly in a unit square.

If `seed` is present, it specifies a seed for the random number generator. If
`seed` is a positive number, this is used as the seed. If it is anything
else, the current time, and possibly the process id, is used to pick a seed,
thereby making the choice more random. In this case, the seed value is stored
in the graph.

If the value is just `"random"`, a time-based seed is chosen.

Note that input positions, specified by a node's [`pos`]({{< relref "../attrs/pos.md" >}}) attribute, are
only used when the style is `"random"`.
