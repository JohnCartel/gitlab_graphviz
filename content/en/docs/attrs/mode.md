[`neato`](/docs/layouts/neato/) supports modes:

* `mode="major"`: `neato` uses stress majorization[^1].
* `mode="KK"`: `neato` uses the Kamada-Kawai[^2] version of the gradient descent method.
  `KK` is sometimes appreciably faster for small (number of nodes < 100) graphs.
  A significant disadvantage is that `KK` may cycle.
* `mode="sgd"`: `neato` uses a version of the Stochastic Gradient Descent[^3] method.
  `sgd`'s advantage is faster and more reliable convergence than both the previous methods,
  while `sgd`'s disadvantage is that it runs in a fixed number of iterations and
  may require larger values of [`maxiter`]({{< relref "maxiter.md" >}}) in some graphs.

There are two experimental modes in `neato`:

* `mode="hier"`, which adds a top-down directionality similar to the layout used in `dot`, and
* `mode="ipsep"`, which allows the graph to specify minimum vertical and horizontal distances between nodes.
(See the [`sep`]({{< relref "sep.md" >}}) attribute.)
