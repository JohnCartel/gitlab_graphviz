description: Specifies how the distance matrix is computed for the input graph
---

The distance matrix specifies the ideal distance between every pair of nodes.
`neato` attempts to find a layout which best achieves these distances. By
default, it uses the length of the shortest path, where the length of each
edge is given by its [`len`]({{< relref "len.md" >}}) attribute.

* If `model="circuit"`, neato uses the circuit resistance model to compute the
  distances. This tends to emphasize clusters.
* If `model="subset"`, neato uses the subset model. This sets the edge length
  to be the number of nodes that are neighbors of exactly one of the end
  points, and then calculates the shortest paths. This helps to separate
  nodes with high degree.

For more control of distances, one can use `model=mds`. In this case, the
[`len`]({{< relref "len.md" >}}) of an edge is used as the ideal distance between its vertices.

A shortest path calculation is only used for pairs of nodes not connected by
an edge. Thus, by supplying a complete graph, the input can specify all of
the relevant distances.
