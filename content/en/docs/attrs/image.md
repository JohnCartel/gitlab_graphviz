description: Gives the name of a file containing an image to be displayed inside a node
---
The image file must be in one of the recognized
[formats]({{< relref "../outputs/_index.md#image-formats" >}}), typically JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, SVG, or
Postscript, and be able to be converted into the desired output format.

The file must contain the image size information:

* Bitmap formats usually already contain image size.
* PostScript files must contain a line starting with `%%BoundingBox:` followed
  by four integers specifying the lower left x and y coordinates and the upper
  right x and y coordinates of the bounding box for the image, the coordinates
  being in points.
* An SVG image file must contain width and height attributes, typically as part
  of the svg element. The values for these should have the form of a floating
  point number, followed by optional units, e.g., `width="76pt"`. Recognized
  units are in, px, pc, pt, cm and mm for inches, pixels, picas, points,
  centimeters and millimeters, respectively. The default unit is points.

Unlike with the [`shapefile`]({{< relref "shapefile.md" >}}) attribute, the image is treated
as node content rather than the entire node. In particular, an image can be
contained in a node of any shape, not just a rectangle.

Only paths to local resources are supported. If you want to use a URL to a
remote resource, see the

script.
