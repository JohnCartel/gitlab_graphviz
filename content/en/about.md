## Graph Visualization

Graph visualization is a way of representing structural
information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
Automatic graph drawing has many important applications in
software engineering, database and web design, networking,
and in visual interfaces for many other domains.

Graphviz is open source graph visualization software.
It has several main graph layout programs.
See the [Gallery](/gallery) for some sample layouts.
It also has web and interactive graphical interfaces,
and auxiliary tools, libraries, and language bindings.

The [Mac OS X edition of Graphviz](http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/), by
Glen Low, won two 2004 Apple Design Awards.

The Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in
a simple text language, and make diagrams in several useful
formats such as images and SVG for web pages, Postscript for
inclusion in PDF or other documents; or display in an interactive
graph browser.  (Graphviz also supports GXL, an XML dialect.)

Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for
colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and
custom shapes.

In practice, graphs are usually generated from an external
data sources, but they can also be created and edited manually,
either as raw text files or within a graphical editor.
(Graphviz was not intended to be a Visio replacement, so it
is probably frustrating to try to use it that way.)

## Viewers

* **any web browser** can open SVG or PDF generated by Graphviz
* gvedit is a simple viewer and editor in Graphviz written in Qt
* **Mac OS X Graphviz.app** (re-release coming soon)
* **graphviz web sandbox** editors like [graphviz visual editor](https://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/) and [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)
## Filters

* [**gvpr**](/docs/cli/gvpr/) is a general-purpose graph stream editor, in the spirit
of [`awk`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) and [`sed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) (or think of [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) if you don't know those).

## Example applications

* Software documentation: Pretty diagrams automatically generated by 
[doxygen](https://www.doxygen.org/) and dot.
* WWW Graph Server: For a WWW application of Graphviz, please see [Webdot](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/webdot).
* [Canviz](http://code.google.com/p/canviz/), an HTML5 canvas Javascript library.
